First thing in CodeBasics Excel is cleaning the data

I have a dataset that needs to be cleaned using specific functions. They are
# Remove space
Using TRIM (=TRIM(column_name)
# Find Duplicate
Remove Duplicates and use a conditional column 
# Split 
Split the column and rename it according to the column 

--> Data cleaning is an important step in the data analysis process because it ensures that the data is accurate and reliable.

--> The TRIM() function eliminates extra spaces in the text, including those at the start and end.

-->Conditional Formatting helps to identify and highlight duplicate data in a range of cells.

-->The "Text to Columns" feature helps to split a single cell containing text into multiple cells based on a specified delimiter, such as a comma, semicolon, or space
