# Codebasics-Excel-1-

First thing in CodeBasics Excel is cleaning the data

There is a dataset I have to clean with some functions. They are
# Remove space
using TRIM (=TRIM(column_name)
# Find Duplicate
Remove Duplicates and use a conditional column 
# Split 
Split the column and rename it according to the column
